      "body": "John Curran notes:\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n    This is a most excellent document - thanks for all your work on it!\r\n\r\n    Regarding the Recommendation section, I note that the document doesn\u2019t include any mention of importance of the notification capabilities of authentication systems as a means for mitigation possible abuser use of technology. \r\n\r\n    As means of example, I\u2019d refer to the work of the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) and Facebook in making clear possible mitigations to technology by abusers, and their publication \"A guide for Survivors of Abuse\u201d <https://nnedv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Library_TH_2018_Privacy_Safety_Facebook_Guide_Survivors_Abuse.pdf>, which calls out the usefulness of notifications in detecting misuse of technology by abusers - \r\n\r\n>     Login notifications\r\n>\r\n>     You can be notified, either by email or text message, if someone tries to access your account from a computer or device that you haven\u2019t used before.\r\n>\r\n>     Login approvals\r\n>\r\n>     If you are logging into your account from a different web browser or device, you must have a security code to access your account.\r\n>\r\n>     Recognized devices\r\n>\r\n>     You can manage the devices that are allowed to have access to your account and be notified if an unknown device tries to access your account. This is particularly helpful for a survivor who may have wanted to access their account from their partner\u2019s device, but now no longer wants that device to have access.\r\n>\r\n>     Active sessions\r\n>\r\n>     This is important to note because it shows sessions that are currently active or logged on. You may have active sessions if you\u2019ve accessed your account or are using an app and forgot to log off. This also will show if someone else might have accessed your account. In that case, you can choose to \u2018End Activity,\u2019 which will block that device from continuing to access your account.\r\n\r\n    This usefulness of such controls echoed in another recent paper \"A Domestic Violence Dystopia: Abuse via the Internet of Things and Remedies Under Current Law\u201d <https://californialawreview.org/print/a-domestic-violence-dystopia-abuse-via-the-internet-of-things-and-remedies-under-current-law/#clr-toc-heading-10>. which notes implications of technology design on those facing potential abuse \u2013 \"Safe design should also include automatic generation of weekly or monthly reports informing users about their data and account logins, a system notification that shows which registered user initiated the controls, and the standard of requiring that users opt into rather than out of data-sharing between members of a household. \u201c\r\n\r\n    I\u2019d encourage some further discussion on the list of the notification aspects of authentication systems and their potential use in mitigation of abuse via technology, and if found useful, inclusion of additional text in the authentication systems portion of the recommendations.

      "body": "The mitigations listed in Section 5 don't link to the attacks that are mentioned.  This makes it difficult to understand what sort of risks remain if an engineer followed all the advice given.  That is, given a particular attack, what is the particular mitigation?  This is the strategy recommended by RFC 3552, and I think we are wise to follow it here, if necessary with an explanation or references as to why various mitigations are important in that case.  I would presume that a number of the mitigations overlap.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm not suggesting that you delete Section 5.  It can serve as a reasonable summary, and you might even create a table to indicate which mitigations address which attacks.  But neither a table nor a summary are enough to demonstrate appropriate remediation.  Some support is required, if for no other reason, than for us to recognize when there is a potential workaround by the attacker to the remediation",
